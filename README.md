# 🐍 Classic Snake Game — C++ Console Edition

A simple yet fun **Snake Game** developed during my first semester of university as part of the **Computer Programming** course project. This version is written entirely in **C++** and runs in the Windows console.

> Developed by **Talha Zia** and **Aaish Ahmed**

## 🎮 Game Overview

This is a classic terminal-based snake game where the player controls a snake using the keyboard to collect fruit (`$`). Each fruit collected increases the snake’s length and score. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the player exits manually.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Snake movement with real-time input handling
- Fruit spawning and score tracking
- Self-collision and wall collision detection
- ASCII-style terminal rendering
- Classic grid wrap-around behavior
- Clean C++ logic with `enum`, arrays, and structured code
